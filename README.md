# FirstAssignmentGroup_Dio_Andrean_Joshua

This is our first assignment
<br>
we scrape 2 series from IMDB website(DareDevil and Stranger Things)

<br>
we take both season, episode, rating, title, and description

<br>
with this meta, we can make a csv file just with a function(1 function)

<br>
We also add input system, so you can compare many many series

<br>
we add the csv file also in the repo so you can check
